I think most people are going to use [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) or [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) or something if they want to style their code blocks but it wouldn't hurt to make them look _okay_ out of the box, even with no syntax highlighting.

you can write text [with links](http://example.com), optionally


- escape characters are supported
- you can escape a quote inside emphasized text like 'here\'s johnny!'

* single quotes around a phrase place 'emphasis'
  \*\* alternatively, you can put underlines around a phrase to add _emphasis_
* astericks around a phrase make the text _bold_
* pluses around a phrase make it +monospaced+

We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

```ts /sum/#v
const sum = (num1: number, num2: number): number => {
  return num1 + num2;
};

console.log(sum(4, 8)); //12
```

```js /age/#v /name/#v /setAge/#s /setName/#s /50/#i /'Taylor'/#i
const [age, setAge] = useState(50);
const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');
```


<Callout type="default">
  This is a default callout. You can embed **Markdown** inside a `callout`.
</Callout>

> This is a block quote. You can embed **Markdown** inside a `blockquote`.

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.
