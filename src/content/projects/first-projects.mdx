## Introduction

> Using Rem and Em units is better than using px.

When we use px, it means that we hardcode the font-size to all of the users. The user can't change the value whatsoever. This actually troubles the user that wants to have a bigger font-size from the default `16px`

## How do rem works?

Rem and Em is a relative unit that many developers use to preserve accessibility.

> Rem (root em) stands for "root element's font-size"

Usually, the default root font-size is `16px`. So, if we see a font-size that is 1rem, we are looking at 16px

Because Rem means root element's font-size, we can also override the default value by using CSS like this:

```css
:root {
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

Because we changed the root font-size, now `1rem = 20px`

### What if we want to use value other than 16px?

We can get the rem value of a pixels by dividing it with 16px. For example, if we want to use a font-size of 20px, we will write `font-size: 1.25rem`. Which is 20/16.

### But it's so annoying ?!

Yep, using rem will make the development process longer because we need to calculate the rem value. But this gives some freedom to the user, and we are not messing with the accessibility.
